Suddenly, a [animal] wearing a [bizarre article of clothing] popped out of [nonsensical substance] and demanded they [verb that implies chaos] before granting them a [magical object] that smelled like [smell that is worrying]. Inside, a [hybrid creature] was [verb ending in -ing] in a way that bent [abstract concept], and to earn the [legendary item], they had to loudly declare their favorite [mundane household object] while performing the [ridiculous dance move], which immediately caused [plural noun] to [weird action] for no reason at all.</h3>
